First, let’s make a server using node and express to serve a pdf file.
Create a folder called server and inside that folder “run npm” init to create package.json file.
Then let’s install basic dependencies needed by running command
npm install express cors
cors package is used here to avoid cors related errors
Then create a file called app.js and keep it blank for now.
